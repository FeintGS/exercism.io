# What is this?
A repository containing my solutions to Exercism problems. You can find the problems at their website [here](https://exercism.io/), I highly recommend it to keep your coding skills sharp!

# How do I run your solutions?
Start by cloning my repo: `git clone git@github.com:Nagayoshi-dev/exercism.io.git`

Afterwards, just navigate your way to a directory of interest. For now, all of my solutions are in python. You can run them interactively in your shell using the `python3` command.
